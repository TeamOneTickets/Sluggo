# Sluggo
Makes URL slugs from text strings.


## Why another slugging class?
There are [a lot](https://github.com/search?p=2&q=slug+php&source=cc&type=Repositories) of [other](https://github.com/kevinlebrun/slug.php) [classes](https://github.com/fabeat/Slug/blob/master/lib/Slug.class.php) for slugging, and some of these influenced Sluggo, but each one has different nuances. For example, I think `Don't Stop Believin` should end up as `dont-stop-believin` and not as `don-t-stop-believin` and that `68% of statistics are made up` should turn into `68-percent-of-statistics-are-made-up`.
